// RE+ (Reloaded Editor Plus) versioning. This is the one place the version
// lives: the window title, the About box, the self-updater, the DLL's file
// properties (Reloaded.Editor.rc) and tools/package_release.ps1 all read it.
//
// RE+ releases are MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, tagged v<version> on GitHub:
//   MAJOR  2 is RE+. 1.x was AllyPal's Reloaded Editor (1.1 to 1.21) and the
//          1.3.0 betas. Raise it only for a break in compatibility: the
//          install layout, or files earlier versions wrote that it no longer
//          reads.
//   MINOR  a feature release: new tools, windows or workflows. Reset PATCH.
//   PATCH  a release of fixes only.
// PRERELEASE is "" for a release. A candidate that needs testing first is
// "-rc.1", "-rc.2", ... published as a GitHub pre-release; the updater only
// offers pre-releases to editors already running one.
//
// Bump this before packaging each release, or its users are offered the same
// release again on every start.

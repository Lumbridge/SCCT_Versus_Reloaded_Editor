// Updates the editor from the GitHub releases. A short while after start-up
// (unless turned off) and from Help > Check for RE+ Updates, a worker
// thread asks GitHub for the newest release; when it is newer than this DLL
// it offers to install it in a window with the release's notes and download
// size: Install, Remind me later (at the next start or after a chosen delay,
// [Updates] RemindVersion / RemindAfter) or Skip this version
// ([Updates] SkippedVersion). Installing downloads the release archive, checks
// it, and swaps Reloaded.Editor.dll (and the launcher) in place: a loaded DLL
// cannot be overwritten but can be renamed, so the running one becomes
// Reloaded.Editor.dll.old. The new version runs after the editor is
// restarted; that start keeps the .old files as Reloaded.Editor.previous.dll
// (and Reloaded_Editor.previous.exe), which Help > Roll Back puts back, and
// shows the installed release's notes once (Help > What's New shows them on
// demand).
